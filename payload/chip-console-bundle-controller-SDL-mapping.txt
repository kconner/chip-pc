# Custom, for Chip PC bundle gamepad
030000001008000001e5000010010000,usb gamepad           ,platform:Linux,x:b3,a:b2,b:b1,y:b0,back:b8,start:b9,leftshoulder:b4,rightshoulder:b6,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,

Add to the end of ~/.lexaloffle/sdl_controllers.txt.

But even though pico8's log shows the controller is recognized and mapped to player 0, it doesn't do anything when I press buttons.
